# String Calculator TDD Kata

## Overview
This project is an implementation of the **String Calculator Kata**, a popular coding exercise that helps developers practice **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. The goal is to build a simple string-based calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations, while strictly following TDD principles.

## What is TDD?
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual implementation. It follows a simple **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle:

1. **Red** - Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior.
2. **Green** - Implement the minimal amount of code needed to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor** - Improve the code while ensuring all tests continue to pass.

By following this cycle, TDD helps developers create well-structured, maintainable, and bug-free code.

## Expected Features
The String Calculator will support the following operations:
- Adding numbers from a string input.
- Handling an empty string input.
- Supporting different delimiters.
- Ignoring invalid inputs as per requirements.
